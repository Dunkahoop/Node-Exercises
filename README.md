# Node Exercises

This is an assortment of exercises and projects made for my Javascript class in the Winter 2024 semester. You can run `project1`, `project2`, and `reactexercises`, as the other folders are assorted javascript files used as practice/reference

## Stack

- Database: MongoDB
- Back-end: Node.js and Express.js
- Front-end: React

## Usage

To run an app, access the directory of the app's folder in a terminal and run `npm run`. Then, go to the URL `localhost:8080`

It *may* not work because of the fact that my MongoDB cluster is locked, and it's private (I hope my key isn't on here)
